# SolarPCB
Created a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that harvests energy from a solar cell, with the main component being a bq25504 microcontroller that controls the overvoltage and undervoltage for effective charge storage in a 1F supercapacitor. Designed the schematic, layout, and created custom footprints for supercapacitor, switches, and other components.
